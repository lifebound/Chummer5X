## Platform Support

This application supports the following platforms:

- ✅ **Android** - Full support
- ✅ **Windows** - Full support  
- ✅ **Linux** - Full support
- ✅ **Web** - Full support
- ❌ **iOS** - Not supported
- ⏳ **macOS** - Potential future support (releases only, if there's demand)

### Note on iOS Support

Unfortunately, I will not be developing for iOS due to Apple's platform limitations. As this is a free, open-source application with no monetization, the costs and requirements associated with iOS development (Xcode requirements, Apple Developer Program fees, etc.) are not feasible for this project. I hope you understand this decision.

If there's sufficient community demand, I may consider adding macOS builds in the future, but these would be release-only builds without active development support.
